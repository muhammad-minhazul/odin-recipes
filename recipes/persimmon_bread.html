    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      As far as fall baking goes, there are other flavors that hog the limelight
      (we're looking at you, pumpkin spice!). The humble persimmon is oft
      forgotten, except by those who already love its honey-like flavor and know
      that it is only available to enjoy during a short season.

      Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of
      persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is
      easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon. For 1 cup of
      persimmon pulp, you'll need 2 to 3 hachiya persimmons, depending on their
      size. You can also use smaller fuyu persimmons, which typically take
      longer to fully ripen than hachiya.
